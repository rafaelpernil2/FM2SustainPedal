## Why?

A few days ago I bought a KORG FM2 and it did not have sustain pedal support, that is why I created this little web app to provide that functionality.


## Features

* Sustain pedal support - Works as expected
* Sustain latch - Useful for latching the arpeggiator

## Usage

1. Plug in your volca fm2 and a MIDI keyboard to your device
2. Open https://fm2sustain.rafaelpernil.com
3. Select your MIDI keyboard and channel as input
4. Select your volca fm2 as Output device
5. ???
6. Profit!
